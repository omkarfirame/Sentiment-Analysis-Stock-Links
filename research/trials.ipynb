SECTIONS Big movers on D-Street: What should investors do with JSW Steel, Tata Investment and Tata Chemicals? By Akash Podishetti , ETMarkets.comLast Updated: Mar 02, 2024, 09:33:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size AbcSmall AbcMedium AbcLarge Save Print Comment Synopsis ## Benchmark indices hit record highs fueled by economic growth. JSW Steel, Tata Investment, and Tata Chemicals performed well. Tata Investment has broken out of a Flag formation, while Tata Chemicals has shown a recovery. MACD and RSI indicators support Tata Investment\\'s structure. Getty Images Benchmark indices hit record highs on Friday, logging third straight weekly gains, as faster-than-expected economic growth boosted demand amid signals the rally will sustain. Stocks that were in focus include names like JSW Steel, which rose 4.31%, Tata Investment, which jumped 5%, and Tata Chemicals, whose shares increased 3.07% on Friday. _Here\\'s what Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today. _ ## JSW Steel The structure of the counter looks lucrative as it is taking support from 200-DMA and also has a strong demand zone of around Rs 790. The counter is witnessing a breakout of a long consolidation formation on the daily chart with strong volume. On the upside, Rs 880 is an immediate resistance zone; above this, we can expect a Rs 920+ level in the next term. On the downside, Rs 790 is the important support level for any correction. ## Tata Investment The counter has witnessed a breakout of a Flag formation with huge volume. The structure of the counter is classical, as it is trading above all its important moving averages. The overall structure of the counter is lucrative, as it is trading above its important moving averages. MACD (moving average convergence divergence) supports the current strength, whereas the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is also positively poised. On the higher side, Rs 8,000 is acting as an important psychological level; above this, we can expect the level of Rs 8,700+ in the near-short term, while on the lower side, Rs 6,700 will act as a major support during any correction. ## Tata Chemicals The counter is in a downward trend, but in the last trading sessions, it has given an astute recovery from the 940-950 level with strong volume, which was multi-month support for the counter. The overall structure is distorted as it is trading below all its important moving averages, but it has a demand zone near 940-950. On the upside, Rs 1000 is an immediate susceptible area; above this, we can expect a run-up towards Rs 1,020 in the near term, while Rs 940 is an immediate support level.
